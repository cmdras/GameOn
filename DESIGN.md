#### Storyboard

This is the login screen, where users can register and login to their accounts. By logging in, users are presented a tab bar, with the following view controllers.

The buttons at the top of the screen will not be included in the final version. At the moment they serve as placeholders for pressing an item on the tableview. Pressing the button on the Game tab will perform a segue to the following screen.

On the game info screen, various information will be given about the game. Pressing the button will reveal what users are playing this game. An option will then be given to follow that player.

Pressing the button on the Players tab will present a tableview of all the games that that user is playing.

The Chat tab will have two different segues. If an open chat in the tableview is pressed, that chat will be opened on the chat screen. If the new chat button
is pressed, a tableview of all followed players will be presented. If a cell of the tableview is pressed (which is the username), a chat will be 
opened with that user. A mockup of the chatscreen:
