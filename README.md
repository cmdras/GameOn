# Game On
#### A gaming messenger app
#### Chris Ras. 10689958

In the Game On app, gamers can reach out and chat to other players playing the same game. Users will be able to manage a list of games that they are playing, and find players that are playing the same game. Users will be able to chat with each other. 

#### Purpose
This app can be useful for Gamers who want to meet new people who share their interest in particular games, and for gamers who are looking for people to play online with. It is also useful for people who need help getting through a particular stage, or for gamers who are trying to form a team. In short, it's an app that helps Gamers communicate with each other about specific games. 

#### What will be needed:
* A live database API for user management (Such as Firebase)
* A chat API
* A list of games stored in a database.
  * This could be either in an existing database or a database that the users can add to.

#### Decomposing the problem
* Login/Registration
* Users list of games
* Searching players by game and following them
* Friendlist management
* Chatrooms

#### Discord
Discord is a similar app which is used by many gamers to interact with each other. The difference is that Game On will allow users to find players by game rather than by channel (Not to say that it isn't possible to find game channels in Discord). 

#### Optional features
* Chat with multiple people
* Recent player activity
* Youtube videos for user's games
